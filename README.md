# ML_projects
General projects on Machine Learning 
<br/>
Multiple examples on Regressions, Classifications and SVMs 
## Project Descriptions
#### Logicstic_regression_example 
This is the example of Logistic regression.<br/>
Data = "heights" from package = "caret"<br/>
The sex of an individual is predicted based on heights 

#### Airfoil Self_Noise Dataset - Regression Problem
Airfoil self_noise dataset is a dataset NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. Using the attributes given, the atmospheric Pressure Levels are predicted using:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
